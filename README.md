# Premier League Season Explorer

A final project for [CS 6630 - Data Visualization Fall 2020](http://dataviscourse.net/2020/index.html)

## Project Info
It’s easy to tell who wins the Premier League at the end of the year, but how did they get there? What were the challenging games that could have broken their championship season? What were their best games? 

What about the other teams, who won the #alternativetables? If you look at just the Christmas games, the first half of the season, the post-lockdown games, who would have come out on top?

Finally, 2019/2020 was a big year for manager changes. We’ll show the “eras” of the managers and answer questions about whether it was necessary to sack them in the first place. How did the new guy compare?

We all have an interest in soccer, while Jakob and Brian religiously follow the Premier League. Thus, we decided to choose this project as playing to our interests. All of us love looking for trends in data, with a particular interest in sports data.

## Project Objectives
Interactively visualize a single English Premier League (EPL) season with a game-by-game breakdown for all teams in the EPL.

Show how each team performed versus other teams, and as a function of time over the entire season. Allow the user to zoom in on individual games and see the significant events during each game, such as who scored or who was shown a red card.

Tell stories about the season in by-team view. For example, show when a manager was sacked and compare performance on either side of this event, or see when a team played a champions league match and whether it seemed to affect their performance in league matches.

Aside from our objectives in creating a suitable visualization for the data, we would like to utilize this time to learn more JavaScript/D3/programming techniques that we will utilize in our chosen career paths post-graduation. We would like to learn how to create an effective visualization and wrangle data into appropriate forms from scratch, using our creativity and knowledge without relying on visualization templates or other such interventions from people knowledgeable on the subject. Additionally, we would like to gain experience working as a team while coding: a skill that is not often taught in classes and that we can take unique advantage of during this project.
