# Premier League Season Explorer Feedback
We got feedback from both KyungYoon and Daniel, they were both great and had excellent ideas. Feedback consisted mainly of clarifying what we are doing and making sure it was easy to read/use. They brought up an excellent point about color use in the bump chart, where we decided we will use the teams main color and crest to make sure the lines are properly distinguishable from each other. 

# Project Peer Review: COVID-19
by KyungYoon Kim and Daniel Pak

### Are the objectives interesting to the target audience? 
Yes, focusing on current events

### Is the scope of the project appropriate? If not, suggest improvements.
Yes, they will be using an API to pull the data when the website is loaded, so this will make the visualization slightly harder to design as you can't edit the input data, but it makes it more responsive and interesting.

### Is the split between optional and must-have features appropriate? Why?
It's good, but I think a number of the items in optional will need to be done to make the visualization innovative enough.

### Is the visualization innovative? Creative? Why?
Yeah, mostly. It's close to HW 6 in many ways, but with the addition of a force diagram and the API, I think the visualization is innovative enough. 

### Does the visualization scale to the used dataset? Could it handle larger but similar datasets? 
Yes, it'll need to scale automatically as the data is provided by an API and can change with each refresh.

### Is the project plan detailed enough? Is a path to the final project clear?
For the most part, the objectives and schedule could be a little bit more defined but they seem to have the path to the final project laid out well. 

### Is an interesting story told?
Yeah, it's been done quite a bit before, tracking the spread of the Coronavirus, but I think breaking it down by continent/country will be interesting. 

## Visual Encoding
### Does the visualization follow the principles used in class? 
Yes, their visualizations are well-designed, they aren't 3D or something.

### What is the primary visual encoding? Does it match the most important aspect of the data?
Position in the bubble chart and length in the bar chart. It does match, it's the simplest way to show the data they are using, and that is always the way to go.

### What other visual variables are used? Are they effective?
Color for countries, grouping for continents. These variable are the best available for grouping/distinction in this context. 

### Is color sensibly used? If not, suggest improvements.
Seems to be, colors are temporary for now, but they don't seem to have a huge effect on data readability/analysis. 

## Interaction and Animation
### Is the interaction meaningful? If not, suggest improvements.
Yes, dragging the timeline around then clicking the play button will be really great, useful for watching peaks and how quickly certain countries spiked.

### If multiple views, are they coordinated? If not, would it be meaningful?
Yes, they have a line chart of the total cases and a bubble/beeswarm chart of the data per country, the main use of the line chart is as a contextual timeline

### Is there any animation planned? Is it clear? Is it intuitive? 
Yes, there is a timeline that will "play" the spread of the virus.
